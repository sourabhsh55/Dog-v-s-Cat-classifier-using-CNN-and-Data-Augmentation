# Dog-v-s-Cat-classifier-using-CNN-and-Data-Augmentat
CNN is very useful for image classification purposes. And if we feed some Augmented images into this cnn model then it outperform in very worse cases also..
firstly, all the images should be converted into same sizes becoz cnn takes the same size images for training(acc to its input_shape) # //.resizing images notebook.//
after that...,all the images are first feeded to the ImageDataGenerator for producing more diff images(augmented images).
and then feeded to the CNN model #//.Dog&Cat classifier notebook.//
